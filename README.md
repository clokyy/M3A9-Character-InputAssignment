 Assignment  Goal: This program was designed to teach you how to instantiate characters. It will also show me that you are able to introduce characters, strings, and white space.  

Project Description: Write a Python program to print a string of your choosing into a specific format (see the output sample).  I would like the string to be the lyrics of song related to our faith, (even though the sample does not).  

Comment Requirements:   

Program name: (The name you gave the program)  

Student name: (Your name)  

Date: (The date you completed the program)  

Program Description:  

*These comments are the basic expectation I have. You should include comments throughout the program.   Sample output    If you can think of another symbol that represents our faith you can shape your lyrics into that shape as well.
